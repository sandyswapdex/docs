# Tokenomics

{% hint style="info" %}
The $SANDY token is currently deployed on the zkEVM network at 0x2fb07861dbcfdd08883b0629c49c94320acbb7bc
{% endhint %}

**$SANDY** is a scarce ERC20 token with a maximum circulation of 100 billion tokens. The majority of **$SANDY** tokens have been allocated to support community and ecosystem-related initiatives, reflecting **$SANDY**'s commitment to being a coin governed and controlled by its community.

To achieve a high level of distribution and decentralization among token holders, the token supply will be gradually released over a 100-year period.&#x20;

**Initial market cap:** 5,000,000$
