# Potential Polygon zkEVM Airdrop

Given the recent Arbitrum Foundation's distribution of $ARB tokens to its users and prominent protocols operating on Arbitrum, there is increasing speculation that other Layer 2 chains, such as Polygon zkEVM, may contemplate a similar strategy.&#x20;

While the Polygon team has merely hinted at the possibility of introducing a native token airdrop, they have expressed their intent to launch a governance token down the line.

In the event that SandySwap receives a share of this governance token airdrop, we are fully committed to distributing these tokens as supplementary incentives to our community, with a significant portion retroactively awarded to our early adopters on Polygon zkEVM. Our proposed distribution plan for the airdrop is as follows:

1. 60% of the airdrop allocation will be reserved for SANDY token holders.
2. 30% will be earmarked for future incentives and strategic initiatives.
3. The remaining 10% will be allocated to our development fund to support ongoing platform enhancements.
